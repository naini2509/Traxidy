What-If Analysis Dashboard
Project Description:
This project is a web-based What-If Analysis Dashboard built using Streamlit, designed to explore synthetic project scenarios and predict Green-Yellow-Red (GYR) project statuses.

The dashboard provides:
Interactive sliders to adjust project parameters.
Predictions of GYR status based on a trained predictive model.
An option to view synthetic project data generated using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
The tool supports project managers and decision-makers in evaluating potential project scenarios and identifying key areas for improvement.

Features:
Adjustable Project Parameters:
Use sliders to input project parameters like open issues count, open risks count, etc.
Predictive Analysis:
Predict the GYR status (Green, Yellow, or Red) based on the inputs.
Synthetic Dataset Visualization:
Explore synthetic project scenarios generated using machine learning.
Interactive and User-Friendly:
Intuitive layout and visualization for seamless interaction.

Project Workflow:
Data Collection and Preparation:
Historical project data gathered from SQL.
Preprocessed for model training.

Generative Model Training:
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic project scenarios.
Predictive Model Training:

Random Forest Classifier trained to predict GYR statuses.

Dashboard Deployment:
Web app built with Streamlit for real-time what-if analysis.
